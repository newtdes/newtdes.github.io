## Introduction

This HKUST page is made pretty spontaneously. I started to think about making a page dedicating for HKUST right after I started my website. HKUST to me is a love-hate relationship. I love so many things at HKUST, but at the same time I hate a lot of things (and probably more than the things I love in terms of number) at HKUST.
