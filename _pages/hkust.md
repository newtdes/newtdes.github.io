## Introduction

This HKUST page is made pretty spontaneously. I started to think about making a page dedicating for HKUST right after I started my website. HKUST to me is a love-hate relationship. I love so many things at HKUST, but at the same time I hate a lot of things (and probably more than the things I love in terms of number) at HKUST.

During my time at HKUST, I was fortunate to have an exchange study to UPenn. This page is also dedicated to people I met at Penn, and all the great courses I have learnt there. Penn experience is unique, and honestly I hope to visit that great university again!

I also want to use this space to share courses that I have taken at HKUST, for current and prospective students. However, the most important thing to survive at HKUST is not finding past paper / reading my experience, but to **find your community** at HKUST!

## My Research Journey

## Life Diary

2025/05/04 Dimsum at China Garden. It is pretty hard to gather every person at 1 time.

I asked Andy if he would be free on Sunday, he asked Vincent and Sienna. Then, Vincent and Sienna asked me XD. We were playing a circle game lol!
