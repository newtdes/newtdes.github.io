## Introduction

This HKUST page is made pretty spontaneously. I started to think about making a page dedicating for HKUST right after I started my website. HKUST to me is a love-hate relationship. I love so many things at HKUST, but at the same time I hate a lot of things (and probably more than the things I love in terms of number) at HKUST.

During my time at HKUST, I was fortunate to have an exchange study to UPenn. This page is also dedicated to people I met at Penn, and all the great courses I have learnt there. Penn experience is unique, and honestly I hope to visit that great university again!

I also want to use this space to share courses that I have taken at HKUST, for current and prospective students. However, the most important thing to survive at HKUST is not finding past paper / reading my experience, but to **find your community** at HKUST!

## Tribute to my friends

In no particular order and preference, I want to pay early tribute to my friends here, who are very supportive towards me, who have been carrying me throughout my time at HKUST. Without them, I cannot survive in this intense environment!

I actually remember my friends' English romanization, since I believe it is important to remember people's names as a whole. 

1. Brian Chen Shr-en, from Taiwan

Okay, I can say that Brian and I took a lot of classes together, but we did not actually open our mouth to start a conversation until Fall 2024. Brian's mind is brilliant, and honestly I do not know how many times I have to emphasize the word **brilliant**. He excels in both mathematics and computer science, and to me he is like 學長 (xuezhang or hsueh ch'ang, means senior) due to his pretty mature personality.

We also went to Shanghai, with Sylvia as well :). It was such a memorable trip!

Courses take together: MATH 3423, COMP 4211, COMP 3711H, and COMP 5331 (but he dropped lol)

2. Darren Shawn Chua, from the Philippines

I actually had no friends in my year 1 due to Covid-19 pandemic, but I was fortunate to sit next to Darren in COMP 2211 class. Darren is nice and smart, but he is a bit towards on deadline fighter (so a bit opposite to me haha). We did a project together in COMP 4211, and honestly at that time I was so afraid we could not make it on time. 

Darren also majors in DSCT, COSC, and MATH.

Courses take together: MATH 2121, COMP 2211, MATH 4321, MATH 3423, COMP 4211, COMP 3711H (I think I still lost some courses since we took too many courses together)
