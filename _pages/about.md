About me
======
Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I'm final-year student at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am studying Computer Science (CSE), Mathematics (MATH), Data Science (DSCT), and General Business Management (GBM) (but more in Finance and Economics). I am also a proud [Saigonese](https://saigoneer.com/saigon-culture/837-the-saigonese)! Click into "Saigonese" to know a brief introduction about my city, [Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City)!

My journey at HKUST that leads to that many majors is unpredictable and lucky, but I feel fortunate to have the support of my family and a group of nice and supportive friends around :). Probably I should have a page for my friends in my website.

My current hobbies that I figure it out are mainly about Large Language Models,Data Mining, Machine Learning topic in general, and Maths Finance. Wait more for my upcoming publications with my DDP friends!

I am also working on session-based recommender systems (this should also be my final year project), as well as collaborating with my friend on a project about learning users' utility through interaction algorithms. Both are supervised by Prof. Raymond Wong.

My hobbies (that do not relate to academics at all :P) is to watch movies, read books (that not so many people read :P), and learn languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin（國語）and Cantonese（廣東話）although my Cantonese does not get any better.

I am also a Poker player, and a fan of boardgame (althought I don't play much :P).

Weekly Calendar
=====
Change to "Week" if you want to view it easier. The default mode is "Month" (at least this is what I see on my side).

Scroll up and down to see more timeslot (the default is from 12PM to 11PM).
