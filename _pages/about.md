About me
======
Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I'm senior (or junior, depends on your perspectives) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am fortunate to study Computer Science (CSE), Mathematics (MATH), Data Science (DSCT), and General Business Management (GBM) (but more in Finance and Economics). I expect to graduate in 2026.

My journey at HKUST that leads to that many majors is unpredictable and lucky, but I feel fortunate to have the support of my family and a group of nice and supportive friends around :). Probably I should have a page for my friends in my website.

My current hobbies that I figure it out are mainly about Statistical Learning and Finance. I am interested in doing research about applications of machine learning in investment, and in finance in general. I am also interested in other ML-related topics: for example, I am also exploring recommendation systems.

My hobbies (that do not relate to academics at all :P) is to watch movies, read books (that not so many people read :P), and learn languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin（國語）and Cantonese（廣東話）although my Cantonese does not get any better.
