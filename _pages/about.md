About me
======
Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I'm junior (or sophomore, depends on your perspectives) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am currently studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics.

My hobbies (that relate to academics :P) is mainly about Economics, Finance, and a bit in Politics. Currently, I am doing research that applies a simple machine learning model to identify price patterns that are highly predictable of returns. I also like to read about how different political institutions can affect a country's economic development, and whether it is possible that an institution is superior than the others.

My hobbies (that do not relate to academics at all :P) is to watch movies, read books (that not so many people read :P), and learn languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin（國語）and Cantonese（廣東話）although my Cantonese does not get any better.
