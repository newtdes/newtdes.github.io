About me
======
Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I'm senior (or junior, depends on your perspectives) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am studying Computer Science (CSE), Mathematics (MATH), Data Science (DSCT), and General Business Management (GBM) (but more in Finance and Economics). I expect to graduate in 2026. I am also a proud [Saigonese](https://saigoneer.com/saigon-culture/837-the-saigonese)! Click into "Saigonese" to know a brief introduction about my city, [Saigon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City)!

My journey at HKUST that leads to that many majors is unpredictable and lucky, but I feel fortunate to have the support of my family and a group of nice and supportive friends around :). Probably I should have a page for my friends in my website.

My current hobbies that I figure it out are mainly about Statistical Learning and Quant Finance. For Quant Finance, I am involved in an options pricing project with Prof. Carsten Chong. For Statistical Learning, I am working on recommender systems with the intention of making it my final year thesis, as well as collaborating with my friend on a project about learning users' utility through interaction algorithms. Both are supervised by Prof. Raymond Wong.

My hobbies (that do not relate to academics at all :P) is to watch movies, read books (that not so many people read :P), and learn languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin（國語）and Cantonese（廣東話）although my Cantonese does not get any better.

Change to "Week" if you want to view it easier. The default mode is "Month" (at least this is what I see on my side).

Scroll up and down to see more timeslot (the default is from 12PM to 11PM).
