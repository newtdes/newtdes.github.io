This website is last updated on **02/01/2024**. Still under more constructions!

About me
======
Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I'm senior (or junior, depends on your perspectives) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I am fortunate to study Computer Science (CSE), Mathematics (MATH), Data Science (DSCT), and General Business Management (GBM) (but more in Finance and Economics). I expect to graduate in 2026.

My journey at HKUST that leads to that many majors is unpredictable and lucky, but I feel fortunate to have the support of my family and a group of nice and supportive friends around :). Probably I should have a page for my friends in my website.

My current hobbies that I figure it out are mainly about Statistical Learning and Finance. I am interested in doing research about applications of machine learning in investment, and in finance in general. I am also interested in other ML-related topics: for example, I am also exploring recommendation systems.

My hobbies (that do not relate to academics at all :P) is to watch movies, read books (that not so many people read :P), and learn languages. Currently, I am learning Mandarin（國語）and Cantonese（廣東話）although my Cantonese does not get any better.

Weekly Calendar

Change to "Week" if you want to view it easier. The default mode is "Month" (at least this is what I see on my side).

Scroll up and down to see more timeslot (the default is from 12PM to 11PM).
