excerpt: 'Clustering is a crucial problem in the realm of databases. It plays an important role in data analysis and pattern recognition. One of the widely recognized algorithms in this domain is K-clustering. However, K-clustering is sensitive to various factors, including outliers, centroids initialization and input perturbations. These characteristics increase the computational cost in attaining the globally optimal solution since multiple runs of the algorithm are often required to achieve more stable and reliable clustering outcomes. In light of these challenges, there has been a growing interest in exploring approaches that can enhance the stability of traditional K-clustering algorithms. The resilient K-clustering algorithm, proposed in Ahmadianâ€™s paper, represents a recent advancement that demonstrates improvement in the resilience of clustering algorithms towards input perturbations. As there is no implementation of the paper before, for this project, we will implement the paper comprehensively.'
