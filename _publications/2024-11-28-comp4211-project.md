excerpt: 'Time series prediction has long been a key field of research across numerous fields, including finance, economics, and computer science. As the number of machine learning tools available for assisting decision-makers in making predictions continues to grow, there is growing interest in leveraging these advanced tools to enhance timely decision-making. In this report, we present a novel application of machine learning aimed at predicting price trends in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency has recently been gaining traction and establishing itself as a significant asset class. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) because they mimic the way traders and human make decisions by analyzing trends in images. These trends are particularly notable in cryptocurrencies due to their highly volatile nature. We train and validate our model on 9 different coins and Bitcoin (BTC), then test our model on the 9 coins, primarily by predicting whether their price will go up or down in the next hour. We will compare the performance of our CNN with a basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on time series data.'

## 1 Background

### 1.1 Motivation

A substantial body of literature explores the application of computer science in financial prediction based on historical trends. Key strategies in this field include price momentum [1], mean reversion [2], sentiment analysis [3], and time series analysis [4].

While these traditional methods can be effective in many contexts, they often overlook the psychological and behavioral factors that drive market movements. Additionally, most existing research primarily concentrates on time-series numerical data. In this project, we propose a novel approach: representing past price data as images and using image analysis to extract meaningful insights.

### 1.2 Methodology

We use historical price data to generate images that represent price movements. Our
model inputs are 54x72 grayscale images to capture price trends from Jan 1st, 2021 until October 31th, 2024. We then use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify
notable trends and features for classification (buy/sell). Afterwards, we compare the
performance of our CNN model with a baseline model. We also independently evaluate
our model based on its profit and loss (PnL) and Sharpe Ratio.

## 2 Dataset and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Background

There is no publicly available image data for cryptocurrencies, so we generate our
own image data. We collect numerical data from Binance and streamline a process to
generate images from this data.

### 2.2 Scrapping Process

We use the Binance API to scrape hourly candlestick information on cryptocurrency
spot from https://data.binance.vision/. We opted for Binance because it has data for a wide range of coins with lots of freedom to choose different specifications. Binance has a separate zip file per day, which we are able to access via a checksum. We automate a process to compile all the zip files and merge them into organized Pandas data frames.

### 2.3 Numerical Dataset Description

Our dataset consists of 10 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Binance coin (BNB),
Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Etherum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL),
Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Stellar (XLM).

For each coin, we have hourly data from Jan 1st, 2021 to October 31th, 2024. This
includes features including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Together, these
comprise ourCryptoTrendimage dataset.

We also run feature engineering, notably by adding a column for our main independent
variable: LogReturns. We get this by dividing the closing price by the opening price.
(np.log(data["Close"]/data["Close"].shift(1)).
