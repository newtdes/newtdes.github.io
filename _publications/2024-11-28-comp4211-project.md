excerpt: 'Time series prediction has long been a key field of research across numerous fields, including finance, economics, and computer science. As the number of machine learning tools available for assisting decision-makers in making predictions continues to grow, there is growing interest in leveraging these advanced tools to enhance timely decision-making. In this report, we present a novel application of machine learning aimed at predicting price trends in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency has recently been gaining traction and establishing itself as a significant asset class. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) because they mimic the way traders and human make decisions by analyzing trends in images. These trends are particularly notable in cryptocurrencies due to their highly volatile nature. We train and validate our model on 9 different coins and Bitcoin (BTC), then test our model on the 9 coins, primarily by predicting whether their price will go up or down in the next hour. We will compare the performance of our CNN with a basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on time series data.'

## 1 Background

### 1.1 Motivation

A substantial body of literature explores the application of computer science in financial prediction based on historical trends. Key strategies in this field include price momentum [1], mean reversion [2], sentiment analysis [3], and time series analysis [4].

While these traditional methods can be effective in many contexts, they often overlook the psychological and behavioral factors that drive market movements. Additionally, most existing research primarily concentrates on time-series numerical data. In this project, we propose a novel approach: representing past price data as images and using image analysis to extract meaningful insights.

### 1.2 Methodology

We use historical price data to generate images that represent price movements. Our
model inputs are 54x72 grayscale images to capture price trends from Jan 1st, 2021 until October 31th, 2024. We then use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify
notable trends and features for classification (buy/sell). Afterwards, we compare the
performance of our CNN model with a baseline model. We also independently evaluate
our model based on its profit and loss (PnL) and Sharpe Ratio.

## 2 Dataset and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Background

There is no publicly available image data for cryptocurrencies, so we generate our
own image data. We collect numerical data from Binance and streamline a process to
generate images from this data.

### 2.2 Scrapping Process

We use the Binance API to scrape hourly candlestick information on cryptocurrency
spot from https://data.binance.vision/. We opted for Binance because it has data for a wide range of coins with lots of freedom to choose different specifications. Binance has a separate zip file per day, which we are able to access via a checksum. We automate a process to compile all the zip files and merge them into organized Pandas data frames.

### 2.3 Numerical Dataset Description

Our dataset consists of 10 cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Binance coin (BNB),
Dogecoin (DOGE), Polkadot (DOT), Etherum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL),
Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Stellar (XLM).

For each coin, we have hourly data from Jan 1st, 2021 to October 31th, 2024. This
includes features including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Together, these
comprise ourCryptoTrendimage dataset.

We also run feature engineering, notably by adding a column for our main independent
variable: LogReturns. We get this by dividing the closing price by the opening price.
(np.log(data["Close"]/data["Close"].shift(1)).

We use data from January 1st, 2021 to March 31st, 2024 for training and validation
and data from April 1st, 2024 to October 31th, 2024 for testing. We construct images
which contain Open, High, Low, and Close data over the past 24 hours, which we use
to predict future 1-hour log returns.

### 2.4 Data Processing and Image Engineering

2.4.1 Processing

First, we clean the data we crawl from Binance. Lots of cryptocurrencies have missing
data, so we first check over 30 popular coins and pick the coins with the most complete data. We then filter out a few timestamps that are absent in most coins, leaving only a few missing data points in singular coins, usually over time spans of less than a day. Given the short time frame, we decide to impute the gaps with the last seen numerical values of the appropriate coin.

As we mentioned above, we also add another column for log returns into our dataset. This is motivated by how returns are pseudo log-normally distributed. Log returns possess several notably features, including, but not limited to time-additivity, suitability for statistical analysis, and consistency across different investment horizons. This is opposed to standard returns, which are frequently misleading, particularly when dealing with compounding effects over time.

2.4.2 Image Engineering and CryptoTrend Dataset

Given that we use a CNN for price prediction, we put extra attention into image
engineering. Our main plot utilizes candlestick bars. High and low prices are illustrated by the top and bottom of the vertical bar, respectively. At the same time, we indicate opening and closing prices with small horizontal lines to the left and right, respectively.

In the proposal, we mentioned that we would use 60x64 images. We decided to use a
width of 72 pixels, which corresponds to 3 pixels per hour. Meanwhile, we settled at a height of 54 after lots of trial-and-error, to see which images would yield the clearest opening and closing prices.

The vertical dimension of our image carries the two most important signals. First, it
conveys the price trend of the coins, i.e. whether the coins are on a short-term uptrend or downtrend. Second, it shows the volatility of the coin over that hour. There is a paper [5] that determines that the high-low range over different intervals is helpful for volatility inference.

We decide not to incorporate volume information into the image since we believe that
including a volume chart may confuse the modelâ€™s convolutional layers. Given that
we try to predict future returns with only the past day of data, we also refrain from
including technical indicators such as long-term moving averages.

We then convert images to grayscale, with a black background and white vertical bars.
We make the images as simple as possible to minimize the amount of data we feed
into the model for computation purposes. Additionally, we believe that having color
is redundant since the model can intuit all the relevant information and price trends
from the data.

After generating the images for each coin, we export all of them to a .datfile. We
then use np.memmapto convert those images into numpy arrays.

Figure 4 illustrates 10 images randomly chosen from one of our numpy arrays. This
dataset has 284,000 images, each of which has size 54x72.

We denote this set of images as CryptoTrend.
