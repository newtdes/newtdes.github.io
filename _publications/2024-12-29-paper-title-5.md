excerpt: 'Time series prediction has long been a key field of research across numerous fields, including finance, economics, and computer science. As the number of machine learning tools available for assisting decision-makers in making predictions continues to grow, there is growing interest in leveraging these advanced tools to enhance timely decision-making. In this report, we present a novel application of machine learning aimed at predicting price trends in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency has recently been gaining traction and establishing itself as a significant asset class. We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) because they mimic the way traders and human make decisions by analyzing trends in images. These trends are particularly notable in cryptocurrencies due to their highly volatile nature. We train and validate our model on 9 different coins and Bitcoin (BTC), then test our model on the 9 coins, primarily by predicting whether their price will go up or down in the next hour. We will compare the performance of our CNN with a basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on time series data.'
